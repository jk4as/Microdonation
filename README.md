### How to Use the Website
The steps to use the site are quick and easy:
1. Click the account tab or Get Started Now to access the log in page. From there, you can login with a Google account.
2. Once logged in, on the charities tab, you can either create your own charity or access a pre-existing one.
3. To create your own charity, click the yellow button on the right labeled "Create a Charity" and fill out the form.
4. While filling out the form, you can authorize additional registered users to be able to modify the charity by adding their usernames(emails) to the comma-separated "authorized users" field
5. Once you've created a charity, you can add causes that users can support by clicking the "Create a Cause" button on your charity's page (in the same location as the "Create a Charity" button on the charities page) and filling out the form.
6. If you wish to update or delete your charit(y/ies)/cause(s), you can do so by clicking the buttons beneath them on the respective pages (charities list/charity detail). You must be an authorized user for the charity to be able to do this. Attempts to do so otherwise should send you to a "Not Authorized" page.
7. To support a cause, first add it to your cart by clicking the cart button beneath the cause and then specifying a price.
8. To check out, go to the cart page, follow check out instructions (fill out the form), and then log-in with the Paypal info given below.
9. Once you've checked out and paid with Paypal, you should be navigated to a page telling you that your payment is completed.
10. Once the payment is completed, the transaction should appear under the transaction history for each respective charity based on the money donated to its causes.
